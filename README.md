dotfiles
========

Description
-----------

I keep track of my personal dotfiles using this repository. With this way, I
can simply setup a new machine if I need to. All I need to do is executing the
following commands on a new workstation:

  $ git clone git://github.com/wgriffioen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  $ cd ~/.dotfiles && ./bootstrap.sh

This will install my personal settings, [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussel/oh-my-zsh),
and rbenv.
